# Feature Suggestions and Improvements

This document outlines potential improvements and new features for the Payroll Management System.

## High-Priority Improvements

### 1. Security Enhancements

*   **Password Hashing:** The current system stores passwords in plaintext. This is a critical security vulnerability.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a strong password hashing algorithm like **BCrypt** or **SCrypt** to store passwords securely.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** The existing `role` system is basic. A more robust RBAC implementation is needed.
    *   **Recommendation:** Create a permissions system that restricts access to specific features based on user roles (e.g., Admin, HR, Employee). For example, only Admins should be able to modify system settings.

### 2. Code Quality and Maintainability

*   **Refactor to a Layered Architecture:** The current codebase mixes UI logic with business logic and data access.
    *   **Recommendation:** Refactor the application into a three-layer architecture:
        1.  **Presentation Layer (UI):** The Swing components.
        2.  **Business Logic Layer (BLL):** Handles business rules and logic.
        3.  **Data Access Layer (DAL):** Manages all database interactions.
*   **Improve Error Handling:** Error messages can be more user-friendly and informative for debugging.
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement a global exception handler and a logging framework (like Log4j or SLF4J) to log detailed error information.

### 3. Database Management

*   **Connection Pooling:** The application creates a new database connection for every query, which is inefficient.
    *   **Recommendation:** Integrate a connection pooling library like **HikariCP** or **c3p0** to manage database connections efficiently.
*   **Database Migrations:** The database schema is managed manually with SQL scripts.
    *   **Recommendation:** Use a database migration tool like **Flyway** or **Liquibase** to automate schema changes and version control the database.

## New Feature Suggestions

### 1. Enhanced Reporting

*   **Payroll Summary Reports:** Generate reports that summarize payroll expenses over a selected period (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
*   **Employee Reports:** Create reports on employee demographics, attendance records, and salary history.
*   **Export to PDF/CSV:** Allow users to export all reports to PDF or CSV format.

### 2. Audit Trail

*   **Log User Actions:** Implement an audit trail to log all significant user actions, such as creating, updating, or deleting employee records. This will improve security and accountability.
    *   **Details to log:** User ID, action performed, timestamp, and the affected record.

### 3. System Configuration

*   **Settings Panel:** Create a settings panel for administrators to configure application-wide settings.
    *   **Configurable options:** Tax rates, Provident Fund (PF) contribution percentages, and other payroll parameters.

### 4. Bulk Data Management

*   **CSV Import:** Allow bulk import of new employees from a CSV file to streamline data entry.
*   **CSV Export:** Allow exporting employee data and reports to CSV format.

### 5. User Experience

*   **Dark Mode:** Add a "dark mode" or "theme" option to the UI for a better user experience in different lighting conditions.
*   **Internationalization (i18n):** Add support for multiple languages.
*   **Search and Filtering:** Improve search and filtering capabilities in all data tables.
